# Clinical Text Analysis and Data Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to the Clinical Text Analysis and Data Visualization project repository! This project demonstrates the use of advanced text analysis techniques, specifically in the healthcare domain, to uncover actionable insights from clinical data. The project involves preprocessing clinical text data, extracting key topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and visualizing the results to enhance understanding.

## Contents

- **Lokesh_Kumar_Patnaik_Clinical_Report.ipynb**: A Notebook that contains the code for preprocessing the clinical text data, performing topic modeling, and analyzing the dataset.
- **Clinical Data Analysis and Text Mining.pptx**: A two-page PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, and findings.
- **Lokesh_Kumar_Patnaik Clinical Report Video.mp4**: A video presentation where I walk through the project, explaining the steps, insights, and potential applications in healthcare.
- **healthcare_dataset.csv**: The healthcare dataset used for this analysis (loaded within the notebook).
- **Lokesh_Kumar_Patnaik Clinical Report.docx**: A detailed two-page report outlining the project scope, the techniques used, and the key findings. This document is intended for stakeholders who want a concise overview of the project.

## Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook where the data analysis and text processing are implemented.
- `presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation providing a high-level overview of the project.
- `video.mp4`: A recorded video explaining the project in detail.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clinical-text-analysis.git
   cd clinical-text-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as `pandas`, `spacy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: 
   Open the `notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment to run the analysis and generate visualizations.

## How It Works

- **Text Preprocessing**: We use the spaCy library to clean and preprocess text data, focusing on extracting named entities from the 'Medical Condition' and 'Test Results' columns.
- **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is applied to identify prevalent topics within the clinical text, which helps in understanding common themes in the data.
- **Data Analysis**: The dataset is further analyzed, including scaling financial data, to identify trends and patterns that could be valuable for healthcare decision-making.
- **Visualization**: Visuals such as topic distribution graphs and scaled billing amounts are generated to provide a clearer view of the insights.

## Results

The initial results highlighted the prevalence of specific terms like 'cancer,' which either indicates a strong presence of cancer-related cases or points to the need for refining our model. The project's findings lay the groundwork for more detailed explorations in the future.

## Future Work

- **Refining Topic Modeling**: Improve the preprocessing steps and experiment with different LDA parameters.
- **Expanded Data Analysis**: Dive deeper into correlations and enhance visualizations.
- **Model Validation**: Implement cross-validation to assess model performance.
- **Real-World Application**: Plan for integrating these techniques into real-time healthcare data analysis and decision-making.
